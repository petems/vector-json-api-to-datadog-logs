# vector-json-api-to-datadog-logs

## What is this?

A sandbox/lab repo for showing how Vector can hit an arbitrary JSON API endpoint, transform the data and then send it to the Datadog logs API.

## Why?

A customer had a usecase where they wanted to take logs from an internal API and send off to Datadog for reporting.

Doing this with Vector reduces maintenance cost of writing a custom script, and also allows the transformation data within the JSON (another customer requirement)

## How?

In this demo, Vector is running a simple topology in which the `dummy_http_json` source fetches a JSON 
entry from the `https://dummyjson.com/` API stub.

It then sends those logs off to stdout via the `console` sink for debugging, but more importantly, does a basic transformation (adding a ddsource field) and sends it
to the Datadog Logs API.

To run this scenario, make sure you have the `DD_API_KEY` environment variable set to your Datadog
API key and then run:

```bash
$ docker compose up
```

You should then see the Vector container running, fetching a log from the DummyJSON API and then sending it to Datadog

```
$ docker compose up

Once you've confirmed Vector is up and running, check out the [Logs exporer][logs] and you should see the logs from the Dummy API being added to Datadog.
